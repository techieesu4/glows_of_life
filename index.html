                                 Do you remember the glows on any story games? When we have a mission, we will find this pink or golden glow, and whenever we walk into it, the game will stop and a cutscene will start to play. 
                                 <br><br>
                                 In your life, you can’t see these glows, but they do exist in the form of places where you once created a lot of memories, and now whenever you pass by that place,your life stops altogether and the memory starts to play in your head.

                              <p>Most of the time, these heal you and remind you who you actually are. These are sweet and can’t be erased from you. Even if you came long behind it and tried to recreate it, you couldn’t do it actually.Although you are with the same person or things, you can’t have the same feeling once you try them. Because we've all grown up. Beyond it, as per nature, the moments that you enjoy or that hurt you are truly for the end of the day. If you could feel the same the next day,it could not be the feeling; it may be the memory of the feeling you had.

                                 For the first few times,the cutscenes are good; they are fine, and they bring you a sense of nostalgia, but as the number of times these cutscenes start playing in your head , they go from being annoying to haunting you until you eventually stop facing the place and run away from it.

                                 IBut should we be able to eliminate this cutscene altogether? No,it can't. But you can’t make a stop there, right? We have to face them and get over them, whether they comfort us or hurt us. Until we face it and get over it, these will not leave our minds, so let’s go face our memories,get over them, and move on. Trust me, there are hundreds of cutscenes for us to collect and play in our lives.
